**Q: Can I modify the templates?**
A: Absolutely! After you get comfortable, customize anything.

**Q: What if I have existing notes to organize?**
A: Create `Archive/Pre-2025-System/` and move them there. Process them later in small batches (5 per week).

A: Yes! These folders and templates add to your vault without disrupting anything.

**Q: How much time will this take?**
A: Daily: 5-10 min for idea capture + communication checks
Weekly: 60 min idea review + 30 min communication review
= About 2.5 hours per week total
