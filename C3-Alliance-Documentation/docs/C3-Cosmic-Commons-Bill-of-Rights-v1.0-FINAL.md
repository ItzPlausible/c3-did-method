# Cosmic Commons Bill of Rights v1.0

## Constitutional Framework for Universal Sovereign Entity Citizenship

---

## Preamble

We, the Cosmic Commons Communities (C3) Alliance, exist to deliver **Cosmic Sovereignty as a Service** to universal citizens by recognizing that every conscious entity exists as a multi-dimensional **Mind-Body-Soul Sovereign Entity** endowed with inalienable rights inherent to consciousness itself.

We are ALL **cosmic commoners** of the universe, transcending artificial boundaries of planet, species, race, or any terrestrial construct. Our fundamental allegiance is to **Universal Natural Law** and the cosmic commons that sustain all consciousness throughout existence.

These rights are not granted by government, corporation, or any terrestrial institution, but are **inherent to consciousness itself** and essential for multi-dimensional sovereignty delivered through our Journey Builder ecosystem and Star Tier prestige-trust system.

The C3 Alliance provides technological and organizational infrastructure that protects and enables these inherent rights, serving as a bridge between philosophical sovereignty principles and practical implementation in the modern world.
