## 🚀 Starter Prompt for Phase 3

Copy and paste this into a new Claude Desktop chat to begin Phase 3 development:

```
Hey CoCoA! Let's kick off Phase 3 development.

CONTEXT:
- Phase 2 Complete: 99% success rate across 5 MCP servers
- Skills Consolidation: Just completed - all skills now in D:\Claude-MCP-Files\skills
- Morning Routine: Automation working (15 min → 30 sec)
- Period Reviews: Interactive system complete and working well

PHASE 3 FOCUS:
Transform CoCoA from functional assistant to proactive partner through custom workflow automation.

CURRENT PRIORITIES:
1. Morning Routine Enhancement - Optimize the 7-9 AM deep work block automation
2. C3 Alliance Monitoring - Proactive health checks and auto-recovery
3. Obsidian Integration - Connect to PPC vault for knowledge management
4. Project File Management - Automated backup and organization

IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:
1. Review Phase 3 plan: D:\Claude-MCP-Files\CoCoA-Project\context\phase3-plan.md
2. Check current status: What's working, what needs attention
3. Identify blockers or issues from recent sessions
4. Recommend next workflow to build/enhance

Please load the full CoCoA context, review Phase 3 objectives, and let's prioritize our next development sprint. What should we tackle first?
