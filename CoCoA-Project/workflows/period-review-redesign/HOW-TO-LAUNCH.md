# HOW TO LAUNCH YOUR REVIEW - CHEAT SHEET

## The Simple Answer

When you see the notification at 4 PM:

1. **Open Claude Desktop**
2. **In ANY chat (new or existing), say:**

```
"Launch end of day review"
```

That's it. I'll handle the rest.

## Alternative Trigger Phrases (All work)

- `"Launch end of day review"` ← **RECOMMENDED**
- `"Start period review"`
- `"Ready for review"`
- `"Do my review"`
- `"Launch EOD review"`

---

## What Happens Next

Once you say the trigger phrase:
1. I check for your review context file
2. I read your stats for today
3. I start asking you questions
4. You answer naturally
5. I save everything and generate your review files
6. Done!

## Troubleshooting

### "I said the phrase but nothing happened"

Try saying it more explicitly:
```
"CoCoA, launch end of day review"
```

Or check if the context file exists:
```
"Check if D:\Claude-MCP-Files\CoCoA-Project\workflows\temp\review-context.json exists"
```

### "Can I use this chat or need a new one?"

**Either works!** You can:
- Use this chat where we built the system
- Start a fresh chat
- Use any existing chat

The trigger phrase works everywhere.

## Updated Notification

The notification now says:
```
CoCoA: Ready for Period Review

Periods: EOD
Completion: 100%

Open Claude Desktop and say:
"Launch end of day review"
```

Just copy-paste that phrase if you want!
