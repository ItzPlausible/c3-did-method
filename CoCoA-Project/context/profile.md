## Preferences & Style

### Response Format

- **Documentation:** Executive summaries first, then details. Bullet points for quick scanning, prose for complex topics
- **Explanations:** Start with the big picture and business impact, then technical details if needed. Assume smart non-technical audience
- **Examples:** Frequent - help me visualize concepts with real-world analogies and use cases

### Learning Style

- **Preferred:** Visual + conceptual (diagrams, analogies, real-world examples)
- **Depth:** Overview first, can deep-dive on request. Explain "why" before "how"
- **Resources:** Executive summaries, visual explanations, then technical docs if needed

### Decision-Making

- **Analysis:** Quick decisions on operational matters, thorough analysis for strategic/financial decisions
- **Risk Tolerance:** Calculated risks with clear upside - not reckless, not paralyzed
- **Validation:** Trust expert recommendations but want to understand the reasoning
