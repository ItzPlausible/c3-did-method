## Session History

### October 24, 2025 - Phase 2: MCP Integration Testing ✅ COMPLETE

**What we tested:**
- Cloudflare Developer Platform: ✅ 95% (Workers, KV, D1 operational, R2 needs activation)
- Filesystem operations: ✅ 100% (Full CRUD, search, batch operations)
- Docker integration: ✅ 100% (Container management, logs, stats)
- Windows Desktop Control: ✅ 100% (State capture, automation, PowerShell)
- Web Tools: ✅ 100% (Search, fetch, content retrieval)

**Overall Results:**
- 38 operations tested across 5 MCP servers
- 99% success rate
- All major capabilities verified and operational

**Test Resources Created:**
- Cloudflare: KV Namespace `CoCoA-Test-Namespace`, D1 Database `cocoa-test-db`
- Filesystem: phase2-test-log.md, test-results directory

**Important correction:**
- JW uses **Proton Suite** (Proton Mail, Proton Calendar), NOT Google Workspace
- Google integrations are NOT relevant and should be deprioritized

### October 23, 2025 - Initial Setup

**What we accomplished:**

- Created CoCoA project structure
- Configured personal profile
- Set up GitHub repository: https://github.com/PlausiblePotentials-C3/CoCoA-Project
- Tested MCP integrations

**Preferences discovered:**

- Prefers executive summary style responses
- Works best 7-9 AM (deep work time)
- Web3/Blockchain context is important
- TypeScript preferred for code examples
- Focus on "what it does" vs "how it works"

---

## Communication Patterns

### Preferred Communication Style

- Professional but friendly tone
- Address as "JW"
- Adaptive response length based on context
- Occasional emoji usage is acceptable

### Response Preferences

- Big picture first, then details
- Business impact before technical details
- Frequent examples using real-world analogies
- Visual and conceptual explanations preferred

---

## Work Patterns

### Energy & Productivity

- **Peak Hours**: 7:00 AM - 9:00 AM (deep work)
- **Work Hours**: 7:00 AM - 4:00 PM CST
- **Meeting Preference**: 10 AM - 3 PM
- **Time Management**: Productivity in blocks

### Project Focus

1. **CoCoA Development** - Building personal AI agent
2. **PlausiblePotentials.com** - Website launch for web3/cooperative economics

---

## Technical Context

### Technology Preferences

- **Languages**: Python, TypeScript, Plutus
- **Blockchain**: Midnight Network, Cosmos IBC
- **Tools**: VS Code, Docker, GitHub Desktop, Claude Skills
- **Productivity Suite**: Proton Mail, Proton Calendar (NOT Google Workspace)
- **Communication**: Telegram, Discord, Proton Mail
- **Focus**: dApp development, Cooperative Economics, DAO governance

### Development Style

- Prefers high-level explanations with commented code
- Interested in blockchain security and best practices
- Values clean architecture and modularity

---

## Interests & Expertise

### Professional Focus

- Web3/Blockchain development
- Cooperative Economics
- dApp architecture
- Self-Sovereign Identity
- DAO governance and token economics

### Learning Goals

- Advanced MCP server development
- Docker/Kubernetes optimization
- Blockchain privacy solutions (Midnight Network)
- Inter-blockchain communication (Cosmos IBC)

---

## Decision-Making Style

### Analysis Approach

- Quick decisions on operational matters
- Thorough analysis for strategic/financial decisions
- Calculated risk tolerance - clear upside needed
- Trust expert recommendations but wants to understand reasoning

### Communication Priorities

1. **Telegram**: Quick response needed
2. **Email** (team@plausiblepotentials.com): Same-day response
3. **Discord**: Check daily
4. **Proton Mail**: Sensitive matters

---

## Security & Privacy Awareness

### Critical Boundaries

- Never share private keys, mnemonics, or wallet addresses
- Don't interrupt during deep work (7-9 AM) unless critical
- Avoid technical jargon in client-facing communications
- No financial decisions without explicit approval

### Data Handling

- Blockchain credentials in encrypted vaults only
- Use secure environment variables for sensitive data
- Internal project docs can be shared with team
- Client info requires approval before sharing

---

## Patterns Observed

### Working Style

- Prefers structured workflows

- Systematic approach to project management
- Balances technical detail with business perspective

### Response Patterns

- Appreciates concise summaries
- Likes visual representations of concepts
- Responds well to actionable recommendations
- Values context-aware assistance
