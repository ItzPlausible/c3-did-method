## The Problem Isn't Compensation. It's Ownership.

The family office world is in crisis mode.

79% report difficulty hiring. 54% fear losing key staff. Top CIOs now command $5-7 million packages—and they're still walking out the door.

The industry response? Throw more money at it. Phantom equity. Deferred compensation. Co-investment rights. Carry structures borrowed from private equity.

After 20+ years as a registered investment advisor serving ultra-high-net-worth families and family offices, I've watched this playbook fail repeatedly. And I'm going to tell you why it keeps failing—and what actually works.

## The Data Tells the Real Story

The numbers are stark:

- 92% of family offices with $1B+ report recruiting challenges
- Family offices spend up to 72% of their budgets on C-level staff
- 8,030 family offices now compete for the same talent pool (up from 6,130 in 2019)
- Base salaries up 15% since 2023; bonuses up 26%

But here's the number that should stop every family office principal in their tracks:

**Only 26% of professionals cite compensation as the main barrier.**

Read that again.

Nearly three-quarters of your retention problem has nothing to do with the check you're writing.

**55% say the biggest obstacle is unclear long-term career paths.**

Translation: people don't want bigger golden handcuffs. They want to know they're building something—and that they have a real stake in what they're building.

## The Ownership Illusion

Family offices have gotten creative with compensation structures. On the surface, they look sophisticated:

- **Carry structures** mimicking PE profit-sharing
- **Co-investment rights** letting staff invest alongside the family
- **Phantom equity** offering ownership-like rewards
- **Deferred compensation** designed to lock in talent

But strip away the financial engineering, and these are all simulations of ownership. Approximations. Substitutes for the real thing.

Phantom equity isn't equity. Co-investment rights aren't partnership. Deferred compensation is just delayed payment with strings attached.

Your best people know the difference.

They're leaving for Blackstone, KKR, and Carlyle not because those firms pay more—but because the path to real partnership, real ownership, real stake-holding is visible and achievable.

Family offices are trying to compete on compensation when the battle is actually about structure.

## The Question Nobody's Asking

Here's what I've never heard a family office principal ask:

*"What if we stopped pretending to share ownership—and actually shared it?"*

Not phantom ownership. Not co-investment privileges. Not deferred comp that vests in seven years if the employee stays and hits arbitrary metrics.

Actual structural ownership. A seat at the table. A voice in governance. A genuine stake in the enterprise.

The reason this question never gets asked is because family offices assume their structure is fixed. The family owns. Employees are hired hands—well-compensated hired hands, but hired hands nonetheless.

But that assumption is exactly what's breaking.

## Exit-to-Cooperative: The Structural Solution

There's an alternative to the endless compensation arms race: **Exit-to-Cooperative (E2C)**.

E2C is a succession and transition strategy that converts traditional ownership structures into cooperative models—where the people who create value become genuine stakeholders in the enterprise.

For family offices facing generational transitions, talent crises, or succession planning challenges, E2C offers something no compensation package can deliver:

**Alignment through ownership, not simulation of ownership.**

Here's what that looks like in practice:

- **Key talent becomes actual stakeholders**—not phantom equity holders waiting for a liquidity event that may never come
- **Governance becomes shared**—reducing key-person risk and creating institutional resilience
- **Career paths become clear**—because advancement means increasing stake, voice, and participation
- **Retention solves itself**—because people don't leave what they own

The family office that converts to a cooperative structure doesn't have to compete with PE carry packages. It offers something PE can't: genuine distributed ownership without waiting for an exit that enriches partners while leaving everyone else behind.

## This Isn't Theory

The cooperative model has proven itself across industries and asset classes. Worker cooperatives, platform cooperatives, and multi-stakeholder cooperatives manage billions in assets globally.

What's new is applying this model to wealth management structures—specifically, to family offices facing the exact crisis the data now confirms.

E2C isn't about charity or altruism. It's about recognizing that the ownership structure itself is the source of misalignment—and that no amount of compensation engineering can fix a structural problem.

---

## The Path Forward

If you're a family office principal watching your best people leave for PE, ask yourself:

Are you solving a compensation problem—or avoiding an ownership conversation?

If you're a family office professional weighing your options, ask yourself:

Do you want a bigger phantom equity grant—or an actual stake in something you're helping build?

The family offices that thrive over the next decade won't be the ones who win the compensation arms race. They'll be the ones who change the game entirely.
