# Productivity Guide - Obsidian Idea Management System (Full Reference)

[FULL CONTENT - This is the complete reference guide. For daily operations, use productivity-core.md]

## Purpose
This skill enables Claude to help you manage your complete idea-to-execution workflow in Obsidian. It provides a structured system for capturing, evaluating, developing, and launching ideas while preventing overwhelm and ensuring focus.

## When to Use This Skill
Claude should reference this skill when you:
- Want to capture a new idea quickly
- Need to process/evaluate ideas in your inbox
- Are doing your weekly idea review
- Want to develop an idea further
- Need to move ideas between pipeline stages
- Want to check on active projects
- Are organizing or cleaning up your idea system
- Need help with Obsidian folder structure or templates
- Want metrics or insights on your idea pipeline

## Core Philosophy

### The Pipeline Model
```
📥 CAPTURE (Inbox)     → Raw ideas, 2 min max
    ↓
🔍 PROCESS (Weekly)    → Score & decide: Develop/Simmer/Archive  
    ↓
🔨 DEVELOP (Active)    → Research, validate, plan (max 5-7)
    ↓
🚀 EXECUTE (Project)   → Becomes full project
    ↓
✅ COMPLETE (Archive)  → Close the loop with learnings
```

### Key Principles
1. **Fast Capture** - 2 minutes max, no evaluation during capture
2. **Weekly Processing** - Batch evaluate all ideas once per week
3. **Capacity Limits** - Max 5-7 ideas in development prevents overwhelm
4. **Data-Driven Decisions** - Use assessment matrix, not gut feelings
5. **Archive Guilt-Free** - Most ideas won't launch, and that's okay

## Folder Structure

```
000_Ideas/
├── 000_Ideas-Dashboard.md  ← Weekly starting point
├── 010_Inbox/              ← Capture everything here (2 min)
├── 020_Developing/         ← Working on these (max 5-7)
├── 030_Simmering/          ← Good ideas, wrong timing
├── 040_Active-Projects/    ← Graduated to full projects
└── Archive/
    ├── Completed/          ← Successful launches
    └── Not-Viable/         ← Learned & let go
```

## The Assessment Matrix

Every idea gets scored 1-5 on four dimensions:

1. **Excitement** - Does this excite me personally?
   - 5: Can't stop thinking about it
   - 3: Interesting but not compelling
   - 1: Feels like a chore

2. **Feasibility** - Can I actually do this?
   - 5: Could start today with existing resources
   - 3: Need to learn/acquire some things
   - 1: Major barriers exist

3. **Uniqueness** - Is this differentiated?
   - 5: Haven't seen anything like it
   - 3: Some similar things exist
   - 1: Many competitors/copies exist

4. **Impact** - How many people could this help?
   - 5: Could help thousands+
   - 3: Could help dozens/hundreds
   - 1: Just helps me or a few people

**Viability Score = Average of all four**

**Decision Rules:**
- 4-5/5 → Move to Developing
- 3/5 → Move to Simmering
- 1-2/5 → Archive to Not-Viable
